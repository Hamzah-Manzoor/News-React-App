# News React App

## Overview
The News React App is a web application built with React that provides users with a seamless experience for accessing and reading the latest news articles. This app leverages the NewsAPI to fetch news data, implements React Router for navigation, and utilizes Redux for efficient data management. Users can explore news articles by category, search for specific topics, and read articles in a user-friendly format.

- Entertainment
- Sports
- Health
- Science
- Business

Users can explore news articles within their preferred category.
Each category page allows users to search for specific topics, enhancing the relevance of their news discovery.
